One of many examples of creating 
a simple minesweeper game with swing.

## Features
* Main menu UI
* Create your custom game (Rows, columns and bombs);
* Possibility to customize difficulty level
* Change language

## Main menu
![main_menu](https://github.com/ViktorKaltash/Minesweeper/assets/150521039/2c9136d6-15cb-40f0-abad-9f95da46bd0f)

After launching app you will see a menu with four buttons like 'New game', 'Custom game', 'Options' and 'exit'

## Options

By choosing an 'options' button you can change app language and difficulty to a 'New game'.
he game supports two languages: Russian and English (Default).
If you changing language you have to restart app.

## Custom game

In a 'Custom game' section you can custom your game properties such as rows, columns and bombs count.
You can't apply negative or 'Character' parameters. 

Here's example of custom gamemode:

## New game

After starting a game you can leave in any moment just by pressing 'back' button. After you loose or win you will see
a label above the game.

## WIP
I want to add new features to the project such as:
* add statistic tracking
* add time panel into the game
* try to add database (Maybe?)
